# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Internship @ NTI

This repository contains all Jupyter Notebooks, exercises, and datasets used during my **Machine Learning Internship** at the **National Telecommunication Institute (NTI)**.

---

## ðŸ“š Overview
During this internship, I explored fundamental and advanced concepts in **Machine Learning**, including:
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- Supervised learning (Regression & Classification)  
- Unsupervised learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)  
- Model evaluation & optimization  
- Neural networks and basic Deep Learning  

Each notebook demonstrates practical implementations and experiments using real datasets.
